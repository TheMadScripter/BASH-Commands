# BASH-Commands

Ever since I started to script/code, I have always been plagued with finding out how to accomplish things. Sometimes the provided help pages aren't that helpful or the examples they give on how to use them are not intuitive enough. With that, I plan to change that with this Repo! Look through the command documents to find different ways to use them!
